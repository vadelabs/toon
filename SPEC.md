# TOON Specification

The TOON specification is maintained in a dedicated repository: [github.com/toon-format/spec](https://github.com/toon-format/spec)

## Current Version

## Why a Separate Spec Repository?

The specification is maintained separately to:

- Provide a canonical, language-agnostic source of truth
- Enable independent versioning of spec and implementations
- Support the growing community of TOON implementations across multiple languages
- Facilitate collaboration on spec evolution through a dedicated RFC process
